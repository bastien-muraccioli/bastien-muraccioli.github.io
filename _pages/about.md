I am a Ph.D. researcher in robotics, currently based at the CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory (JRL) in Tsukuba, Japan. My work focuses on **safe and adaptable human-robot collaboration**, with a particular interest in **compliant torque control**, **physical human-robot interaction (pHRI)**, and **real-time visual-linguistic robotic frameworks**.

I am affiliated with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and the University of Montpellier, where I pursue research that bridges control engineering, AI, and embodied intelligence. I aim to develop robotic systems that are not only intelligent but also safe and intuitive for human interaction in real-world environments.

Previously, I earned my M.Sc. in Engineering from Polytech Montpellier and completed research internships at **GrAI Matter Labs** in Paris and **Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology**, where I co-authored a paper for the TEI 2022 conference on social robotics and embodied speech delivery.

My recent work includes:

- A **torque-control framework** for industrial pHRI, accepted at RSS 2025.
- **Scalable Visual Language Robotics (SVLR)**, an open-source framework that enables natural language-based control of robots without retraining.

I'm passionate about blending **deep learning**, **control systems**, and **human-centered design** to improve safety and usability in robotics.

I also occasionally post updates and open-source code—check out my latest posts or [publications](/publications/).
